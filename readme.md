## Setup

For setup do 
```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
or depending on your pip installation
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
instead.

I pip froze my setup. This is an older setup from Novemember 2022. It will not line up with modern versions of software and code may not be forward compatible.
